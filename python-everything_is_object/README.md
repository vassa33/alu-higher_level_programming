# [PYTHON - Everything is object](https://github.com/vassa33/alu-higher_level_programming/tree/main/python-everything_is_object)

## OBJECTIVES ##
A simple, quiz-like project on:

* objects
* references
* assignments
* mutable vs. immutable objects
* aliases
* variable identifiers

### PYTHON SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS ###
* the first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* all code should use the PEP8 style (version 1.7.*)
* all files must be executable
* all files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* all modules should have documentation python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
* all functions (inside and outside of classes) should have documentation
* python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
* .TXT ANSWER FILE REQUIREMENTS
>> only one line  
>> no shebang  
* all files should end with a new line

### Blog Post: Python Objects 
Write a blog post on everything this project covers. It should be organized in the following way:

* ID and Types
* Mutable objects
* Immutable objects
* How differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects and why does it matter?
* How are arguments passed to functions? What does that imply for mutable and immutable objects?
